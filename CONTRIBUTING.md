The best way to profit from Loom technologies is to buy looms and then contribute to the success of the project, either through blogging (but please don't hype!) or open source contributions. Loom holds a provisional patent to protect its core technology from forks. As an open source contributor, we hope you see our patents as a way to compensate you for your contributions without your needing to degrade the value of our coin with a fork. If still you feel the need to fork, please contact us at Loom for a licensing arrangement.
