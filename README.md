Loom &trade;
=====

Loom is a new architecture for blockchain based on the idea of encoding passage of time as data. It can achieve up to **710,000 transactions per second on a 1 gigabit network without data partitioning**. Loom can eventually recover from a fault of any size, and it provides a way to cheaply verify a distributed ledger.

Scaling blockchain has been a difficult challenge.  Not only is scaling throughput a hard problem, but any high performance blockchain has to deal with an ever increasing mountain of data. Scaling bitcoin to just 25,000 transactions per second would create a petabyte of data each year.

We solve both of the problems by solving for time. The key innovation proposed by Loom is Proof of History — encoding passage of time as data into the ledger. Loom uses strong assumption of time to construct simpler and more efficient consensus and storage protocols.

Usage
=====

The build produces a handle of command-line executables in the "target/release/" directory, `client`, `spool` and `loom`.

loom
----

builds the blockchain

```
Usage: loom [options]

Options:
    -h, --help          print this help menu
```


spool
-----

verifies the blockchain

```
Usage: spool [options]

Options:
    -h, --help          print this help menu
```


client
------

user client that implements a basic wallet

```
Usage: client FILE [options]

Options:
    -c                  create a new address
    -x                  transfer
    -b                  check the balance of destination address
    -l, --list          list your addresses and balances
    -h, --help          print this help menu
    -t ADDRESS          destination address
    -f ADDRESS          source address
    -a AMOUNT           amount
```


Build instructions
==================
